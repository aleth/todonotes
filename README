The package lets the user mark things to do later, in a simple and
and visually appealing way.  The package takes several options to
enable customization / finetuning of the visual appearance.

This modified version of the package makes use of the marginnote and 
xkeyval packages and requires the tikz package with version >2.

Modifications:
- uses marginnote instead of marginpar 
	(this means the font size should now be set via \marginfont)
- avoid steps in the line to the note when y offset tiny
- add a circle at end of the line, visually marking the note insertion point
- thinner line width (0.3 pt) and tighter rounded corners
